The works displayed here are my own favorites, but still not comparable to those from other great artists. To view my other works (as well as piano performances), visit my bilibili channel and check the video lists."

		"comment": "The artist's most remarkable works are the Touhou Etudes, arranged from PCB and IN themes. Etudes, or studies, generally involve specific technical difficulties. However, be cautious here since it's possible the technical difficulties you may encounter are: \n1. copied directly from the original music, not suitable for piano; \n2. ineffective for developing your techniques through practice (or maybe they can harm you); \n3. artificially created at the cost of musicality; \n4. unproven if any human can play them well. \nConsidering the complexity of most IN themes, I treat BZ's arrangements as the ultimate effect for performance, although they have the problems I listed above. Most live performances omit certain voices or move them octaves higher or lower, which is totally fine, since every pianist has their limits. It is rare and delighting to find an arrangement that is faithful to the original in an artistic way. \nRegarding PCB themes, I think the etudes are unnecessarily complicated, so they are not listed here. In fact, the same logic applies to the IN arrangements as well -- I feel like they are overkill, but I couldn't find a nice and easier version as a substitute."
