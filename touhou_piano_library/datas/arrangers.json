I'll leave the link here since it's the only one. You may use https://web.archive.org to view it, but the contents (music, scores) are not accessible. I'm afraid this will happen to some other artists as well in the future, and there's really nothing I can do.\nSome more details about Aojiru's works. His circle \"白と黒の夢郷\" (Dreamland of White and Black) did not release any album. A quick search on thbwiki shows that most of his published arrangements were in TAMUSIC's albums. Beside those, he had one arrangement in 「Mirage ～夜奏幻樂団」, one in 「Touhou pianoforteⅡ-Lunatic Rhapsodia-」 and two in 「Eastern Piano & Ensemble -The Concert for Crimson Ladies-」, all of which you can find on youtube or niconico. His homepage had a list of works including both published ones and others (https://web.archive.org/web/20160920051447/http://aoz.sakura.ne.jp/Music.html), but it's not a full list. I recall that in a kkcwkoh video, someone asked where to find Aojiru's Necrofantasia arrangement and was provided a link, which is a touhou music compilation video on niconico. There probably are many more works burried in such type of videos.\nA side note: 白と黒の夢郷 had an older website pre-2011 and it has 209 captures in webarchive (!!). Some arrangement files has also been captured but I can only see a still image without audio. Perhaps it's a browser issue but more likely the audio files were lost. Here's the url if you're interested: https://web.archive.org/web/20111130103044/http://www.mukyou.jp/ \nUpdate 2023/09/19: Magstic is rehosting Aojiru's works: http://magstic.art/2023/05/11/02/ \nUpdate 2023/12/08: PSLCL made a playlist of Aojiru's touhou piano arrangements (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOfFqm4fgQBCp2jfsv-PTtzBCvY8tJF2v) and one of his other works (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOfFqm4fgQBAPd0U7KrL0TX8YGCspxo27)."

		"comment": "The artist's most remarkable works are the Touhou Etudes, arranged from PCB and IN themes. Etudes, or studies, generally involve specific technical difficulties. However, be cautious here since it's possible the technical difficulties you may encounter are: \n1. copied directly from the original music, not suitable for piano; \n2. ineffective for developing your techniques through practice (or maybe they can harm you); \n3. artificially created at the cost of musicality; \n4. unproven if any human can play them well. \nConsidering the complexity of most IN themes, I treat BZ's arrangements as the ultimate effect for performance, although they have the problems I listed above. Most live performances omit certain voices or move them octaves higher or lower, which is totally fine, since every pianist has their limits. It is rare and delighting to find an arrangement that is faithful to the original in an artistic way. \nRegarding PCB themes, I think the etudes are unnecessarily complicated, so they are not listed here. In fact, the same logic applies to the IN arrangements as well -- I feel like they are overkill, but I couldn't find a nice and easier version as a substitute."

I have to say his sheets are quite messy... \n\nSome notes on practice/performance: \n\n1. Notice the two-part right hand texture. Be sure to distinguish the melody from the accompaniment by playing it louder. The audios didn't demonstrate this enough. \n\n2. All arrangements are loops, just like the original game music, so you will need to add a proper ending yourself."

		"comment": "The artist is probably better known for their synthesia renditions of touhou piano music than their original arrangements. Their website has a \"transcripton\" page which contains all the videos as well as downloadable score and midi files. Their \"transcriptions\" were based on already available sheet music, more like score --> audio rather than audio --> score. Nevertheless, I'm thankful for their work because some of the arrangements have been deleted by the original artists but we can still listen to them and view the scores in Kijiriki's channel and website. Still, be careful using Kijiriki's remade scores, as they might have some differences to the original ones."

I have a bunch of sdf files which I believe came from there, but unfortunately I cannot open them. There are two pdf files among them, 蠢々秋月 (datas/sheets/th08_03_3.pdf) and 明日ハレの日、ケの昨日 (datas/sheets/th10_14_2.pdf). The video mentioned above is the midi for the first arrangement. I didn't list them in music search because their quality is very questionable. They don't fit RD's style (for example, this arrangement https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzJ7ABAQxP8 was released in 2007) and they're more like in the style of 雲音ゆこ or DMBN."
